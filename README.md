# Triangulation of Image
Technology: Winforms
## Description
Application for triangulating images (Low-poly Art).
The operation of the application consists of two algorithms - to gain set of pixels where pixel brightness changes dramatically, and to build Delaunay triangulation on this set.

The result depends on the size of step the algorithm goes through the image and on the threshold value of pixel brightness.
